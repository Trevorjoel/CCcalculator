Crypto currency calculator

This is a practice JS exercise.

The Relevant files are calc.html and calc.js

The objective is for users to calculate their crypto currency portfolio profits back into fiat currency(USD so Far).

1) Select Cryoto currency(ies) they own. See the movement in percentages.
2) Input the amount they own
3) The profits over 1h, 24h, 7d will be calculated across their portfolio spread.
(All of the selected currencies will be calculated to give an overall profit/loss over the above time periods shown above).
4)The user can then add their initial fiat investment to calculate their overall profits.

Just a bit of fun but could be written into wallet applications.

This will be rebuilt and completed with react.js
